SF Games Co-op Thing
================

*NOTE:* I created this repo so we could track our progress on deciding exactly what we want to do with this idea with precise commit messages and diffs - if this is too weird for people we could always move to gdocs or something.

What follows is my very brief and rough overview of a general structure/approach that I think would be cool to try out. I'm hoping that people, when finding issues with different parts of this layout or wanting to add stuff, could make a branch or fork of the repo, apply their changes, and then we can discuss the diff when deciding how we want to move forward. While we're getting started however it'll probably make the most sense for people to just commit to master.
